## Python notebooks demonstrating NVCL_KIT

*NB:* These notebooks assume user has already installed 'nvcl_kit' i.e. has typed this into the notebook

```
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install nvcl_kit
```

If you get a permissions error, then try installing a new kernel

1) File -> New -> Notebook
2) Select "Python 3" kernel, click "Select"
3) Goto [install_nvcl_kit.sh](https://gitlab.com/csiro-geoanalytics/python-shared/nvcl_kit/-/blob/master/notebooks/install_nvcl_kit.sh)
copy text, paste into first cell
4) Hit arrow to execute 
5) Once "[*]" has become a "[1]", you can open an nvcl_kit notebook, change to the kernel to "NVCL KIT" and run it
